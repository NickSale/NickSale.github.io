I am a first year PhD student at Swansea University under the supervision of [Jeff Giansiracusa](https://sites.google.com/view/jeffreygiansiracusa/home) and [Pawel Dlotko](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/science/maths/dlotkopt/), working in the area of Topological Data Analysis. My interests include applications, statistical approaches to persistent homology, and the relationship between TDA and manifold learning techniques.
