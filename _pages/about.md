I am a third year PhD student at Swansea University under the supervision of [Jeff Giansiracusa](https://sites.google.com/view/jeffreygiansiracusa/home) and [Biagio Lucini](http://pyweb.swan.ac.uk/~pybl/), working in the area of Topological Data Analysis. In October I will be starting as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Mathematical Sciences at Swansea University. My interests include applications of TDA to statistical physics and particle physics, topological machine learning, and the relationship between TDA and manifold learning techniques.
